# Python Debugging Task — Helm Values Splitter

## 📖 Overview
This exercise is part of the **Senior DevOps Engineer interview**.  
You’ll be given a small Python script that is supposed to read a YAML configuration file and generate separate `values-<service>.yaml` files for each service.  

However, the script currently **contains several bugs**.  
Your goal is to **debug and fix** it so that it works as expected.
